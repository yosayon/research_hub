# Research Hub

What is a Research Hub?
- an internal research hub that allows multiple users to comb through company data for white paper research! 

What kind of research data is in the research hub?
- the hub houses 10 fake companies' survey data. The hub is not a web app survey but a pro-survey reporting tool. Each of the fake companies listed in the hub also have fake survey data. 

Can you explain a little more about what kind of data Ill see in the research hub?
- I'm so glad you asked ;) A survey consists of 60 statements. Each statement belongs to one of the 5 dimensions. Each statement has a score in the form of a decimal that represents the percentage of employees that rated the statement positively on a likert scale [1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree or Disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree]. The scores are only representing employees from each company that rated the statement a 4 or a 5.
